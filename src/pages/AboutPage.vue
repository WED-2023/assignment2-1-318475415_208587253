      <h1 class="title">About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our site!</p>
      <p>We are Shay Harling and Shahar Revivo, Software and Information Systems Engineering students at Ben Gurion University.</p>
      <p>We met somewhere in 2021 in the first year of the degree and since then we have been inseparable - </p>
      <p>studying together, doing all the assignments together and in the last year even sharing an apartment.</p>
      <p>Beyond our love for code, we share an inexplicable love for food, especially Italian food.</p>
      <p>On our website we will show you our best recipes that comfort us in moments of crisis in studies (and no, there are no shortage of them).</p>
      <p>We invite you to enter the kitchen and enjoy yourself too â™¡ </p>
